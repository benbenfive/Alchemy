# Alchemy

This project is far from over and will continue to be worked on though 
this iteration of code will likely all be scrapped and completely redone.

This is a first prototype created to explore what modularizations and 
class structure will be most suited to proceed in a second iteration.
This also serves as a skeleton for my research into Unreal Engine
as a motivation to learn more. Originally this was going to be a group 
project though the others were too busy to help and nothing they did 
ended up being used.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
